"Structure of Scientific Revolutions" for Creatives
===

Have you read "Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas Kuhn. It's a short book written in abstruse academic language. But it will shatter your ideas of how we do Science. If you grew up thinking Science is about exploring uncharted territory and inventing things no one thought before, then you will be crestfallen after reading this book. As Thomas Kuhn sees it majority of Science we do is more like a bureaucracy than wild wild west. And it's so for good reason. Understanding it why also gives you a good framework for any creative project in other creative fields.
