"Structure of Scientific Revolutions" for Creatives
===

Have you read "Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas Kuhn. It's a short book written in abstruse academic language. But it will shatter your ideas of how we do Science. If you grew up thinking Science is about exploring uncharted territory and inventing things no one thought before, then you will be crestfallen after reading this book. After reading this book you realize that majority of Science is more like a bureaucracy than wild wild west. And it's so for good reason. The book describes two phases of Scientific progress - **Revolutions** and **Normal Science**. The history of scientific progress shows that these phases alternate each other. In each of these phases the scientific community shows specific characteristics. These observations can be fitted to any kind of creative pursuit, either by a group of individuals or even a single individual. Understanding which phase you are in will make it easier for you to carry out your role more effectively.
