Compiler Hatred
===

When you are a novice programmer, you hate compiler for spitting out errors.

When you become an expert programmer, you hate compiler for not spitting out errors that later cause runtime errors.

All the time you hate compiler for spitting out warnings in the code that somebody else wrote.
