Psychology behind Perfection
===

If you are a creative professional trying to make a commercial product, it's essensial to understand the trade-offs involved in achieving or forgoing perfection in your work.

Perfection is always driven by the creator's internal need for order. You may want all the corners in your painting to be perfect right angles or you may want beats in your background music to exactly coincide with the punches your video game character throws. It's not necessary to incorporate such order in your work. The final product will still be complete without them. However such a product won't satisfy your vision of the product. Such need for perfection can result in monumental works of art or it could result in you getting frustrated in the process of achieving that perfection and never releasing the final product at all. That's why it's important to understand the drive behind your need for perfection.

Role of vanity - driven by narratives of successful products from the past which had an idiosyncratic example of perfection. Thinking that it's that drive for perfection that was the reason for success of those products.
Carried away in pursuit of perfection, not knowing if the order you are trying to achieve is even relevant to any of your users.
