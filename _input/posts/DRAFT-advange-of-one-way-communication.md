Advantage of one way communication
===
When a complicated or controversual topic is communicated through a one-way medium like a book, it's better understood than in a face-to-face communication where listener can immediately respond to the speaker.

Let's say in a novel the writer makes a claim that the oncoming car looked like a bull charging in blind fury. It will be hard for the reader to picture a car in the form of a bull. But he cannot protest and argue that it's an impossible metaphor, because he cannot talk to the writer. But as that moment passes and he keeps on reading, he will try to reimagine the car and fit it in the form of bull in some shape or form. This is true about any claims or observations that a writer makes in his writing and the reader disagrees or doesn't understand them initially. Because he cannot talk back, he is bound to extend his imagination to see the writer's point of view. In the process he grows intellectually.

However if one makes such a point in a face-to-face conversation, the listener has chance to immediately respond and express his disagreemnt. Once he has registered his protest, he waits for the speaker to reply and doesnâ€™t bother reflecting upon the point. Thus loosing an opportunity to empathize.
