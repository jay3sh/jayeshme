Principles, Practice and Hypocrisy
===

When someone preaches a principle, but in practice behaves contrary to those values, we call them a Hypocrite. However it's not necessary to discount the ideas proposed by such person only because they cannot practice them.

A person may have a novel insight that goes counter to common sense prevailing in their society at the time. Hence practising the it may cost them dearly in various manners. We know great people in history that came up with an idea that was not acceptable by people surrounding them, yet they fought bravely to publicise it. In fact that's why we know about them as significant personalities in the history. Had they not the courage to make the sacrifices for their principles, would it have decreased the merit of those principles?

It's easy to glorify radical ideas and their thinkers in retrospect. But we forget that the contemporary society was hostile to them. This is important to remember for the sake of our protest to new ideas in our time. There are original thinkers in our times too, but what they propose might be too forward for the society we live in.

Most importantly the person herself should not invalidate their idea because they donâ€™t have strength to act on it in practice. They should be aware of their failure to publicly adopt their ideas, but should not resent it and definitely should not interpret it as invalidation of their idea.
