Guided Imagination
===

Being imaginative is a great asset. If you are in a creative field then you need an active imagination. However I've found over years that you need some discipline when exercising your imagination.

Anyone gifted with wild imagination can think of any kind of exotic things. From a city floating in the cloud to a man that lives in your bathroom mirror. Our mind is always on the run and it's not hard to think of something unusual just by shuffling a few things in that thought. If you have not heard of that thought before, you feel like you have thought of something no one has ever thought before. Then the hubris takes over. The thought remains just that a weird thought. What is it worth?

Any tiny idea like this is not of value until you are willing to explore it further. Branch out your imagination from that first seed of the idea. Push one of the branches as further as you can, then come back and start in another direction. Only when you can develop a sizable world around that initial idea, will it be of potential value.

As a science fiction writer you can think of an alien planet that has species with three genders and it requires one of each kind to procreate. It's a nice imaginative idea. We generally don't know life forms that require more than two sexes to reproduce. So not everyone thinks of it. But on its own it's just a variation of earthly reproductive system. To make a good scifi novel out of it, you need to imagine the causes and consequences of this kind of reproduction. (For example read Asimov’s “The Gods Themselves”).

The same principle is applicable in developing any creative work.

It's something that I've to remind myself too. Here are few tips that I've found useful.

* Make list of all the exotic ideas you get from time to time. Don't flatter yourself too much one the novelty of your idea. Try to develop it as much as you can when it initially comes to the mind. Because the inital spark is sometimes very strong and you may see a lot of things in that moment of inspiration. Write them down.

* Later on go over your list and choose one of the ideas. Then expand on that single idea in every possible direction. You will have to repeat this process again and again, until you come up with something that's deliverable. Many times you need to warm up before you can again start imagining. Reading or reviewing what you've already done helps you in that. It gently puts you back into the world that you need to develop.

* Another exercise is, don’t start with an idea of your own. Steal it from somewhere else. Then create your own universe around that idea.

* Once you start imagining things, there’s generally no limit. There are so many variables and it eventually becomes frustrating and fruitless exercise to balance all these variables. In such cases it helps to identify some variables and fix them. If you are imagining the city of Columbia floating in the clouds, you will have to draw the line when describing the engieering required to build such city. You are not designing a plan to build a floating city, you just need to convince the player that it's possible. So it might make sense to stop at gigantic zeppline ships and gas baloons.

It's not important how far away from the norm do you go with your imagination, but how much area do you explore once you are there.
